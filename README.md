# Conway-Game-of-Life
This is my ~~console~~ Java Swing GUI implementation of John Conway's Game of Life cellular automata

Generation of cells is dictated by these simple rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### To-Do
- Auto-generation button
- drag-click to create cells rather than singly clicking each space
